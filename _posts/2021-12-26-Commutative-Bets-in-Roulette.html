    If you're the type of person who likes to spread their bets around the Roulette table, you should know 
    about the Commutative Property of Roulette Bets. It can save you a lot of time and hassle if your bets
    are consolidated in certain areas.
</p>

<h2>What is the Distributive Property of Roulette Bets?</h2>
<p>
    The Commutative Property of Roulette states
</p>
<blockquote>
    Betting $1 each on n numbers straight-up is equivalent to betting $n on an n-number bet
    containing the same numbers
</blockquote>
<p>
    In other words
</p>
<p>
    \begin{align}
    $X \times N \times Payout_{1-number-bet} & = $NX \times Payout_{N-number-bet} \\
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    So if you bet $1 on the numbers 1 through 6 straight-up, it is equivalent to betting $6 on the 1-6 Double
    Street bet.
</p>
<p>

<p>
    <figure>
        <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/posts/2021-12-26/roulette-02-1x6.png" alt="$6 on the 1-6 Double Street" />
        <figcaption>$6 on the 1-6 Double Street bet ("consolidated" bet)</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>
    If we look at these two sets of wagers, we can easily see that hitting any number outside of 1-6 will result
    in a $6 loss. So what happens when we hit any number between 1-6?
</p>
<p>
    With the six $1 Straight-up bets, we will lose $5, but win $35 on the straight-up bet, for a net win of $30.
</p>
<p>
    With the single $6 Double Street bet, we win 5-to-1, for a net win of $30.
</p>
<p>
    And this Commutative Property of Roulette Bets works with any combination of bets where the bets are all
    uniform. So you can consolidate three straight-up bets into a 3 number Street bet. And you can consolidate 
    four straight-up bets into one 4 number Corner bet. You can even consolidate two Street bets into a single
    Double Street bet.

        <figcaption>$3 on the 1-3 Street bet</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>
    And this works for <i>all</i> bets with the exception of the 5 number (Basket) bet, which is a bet on the numbers
    0, 00, 1, 2, and 3.
</p>
<h2>What is this Sorcery?</h2>
<p>
    This all magically works out because all Roulette Bets would be "fair" (i.e. There would be no House Edge) if There
    were no Zeroes on the wheel. So as long as your <i>density</i> of bets is consistent (the amount of money bet evenly across
    numbers), then the payout should be identical.
</p>
<p>
    And we can prove this mathematcially. The payout for every bet in Roulette (besides the 5 number "Basket" bet) can
    be calculated by using the formula:
</p>
<p>
    $$ { Payout_{n-number-bet} } = { {36 - n} \over n } $$

<p>
    So an $n wager on an n-number bet can be calculated as
</p>
<p>
    \begin{align}
    n \times { Payout_{n-number-bet} } & = { n \times { {36 - n} \over n } } \\
    \\
    & = 36 - n \\
    \\
    & = 36 - 1 - n + 1 \\
    \\
    & = { {36 - 1} \over 1 } - (n - 1) \\
    \\
    & = { Payout_{1-number-bet} } - (n - 1) \\
    \end{align}
</p>
<p>
    Which is the win from a single $1 straight-up bet minus the (n-1) losses from the losing straight-up bets.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if you bet $1 on 12 numbers straight-up, then one of those bets will win $35 and 11 of those
    bets will lose, for a net win of $24, which is what your payout would be for betting $12 on a dozen or a
    column.
</p>
<p>
    \begin{align}
    $12 \times { Payout_{12-number-bet} } & = { Payout_{1-number-bet} } - (12 - 1) \\
    \\
    & = $35 - $11 \\
    \\
    & = $24 \\
    \end{align}

</p>
