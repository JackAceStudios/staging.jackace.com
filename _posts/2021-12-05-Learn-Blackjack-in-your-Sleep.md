Memorizing the 281 decisions needed to master [Blackjack's Basic Strategy]({{site.baseurl}}/gambling/blackjack/systems/basic-strategy/charts/MD_S17) can be a daunting
task. You can stare at the charts for hours, or you could print out blank tables that you fill out over and over by hand. But now there's a *better* way!

Just play one of my [Soundcloud Blackjack Basic Strategy playlists](https://soundcloud.com/jackacestudios/sets/blackjack-basic-strategy-mds17)
on shuffle, and you'll have the entire chart memorized in no time!

These audio tracks act as audible "flashcards" that will recite a random player hand and dealer upcard. After you mentally respond with the correct action, the
track will reveal the correct basic strategy decision.

Check out one of the playlists here:

&nbsp;

I've created playlists for every combination of decks (Single deck, Double deck, and 4+ decks) and for Hitting/Standing on Soft 17. Pick
[the playlist](https://soundcloud.com/jackacestudios/sets) that matches your favorite casino's house rules. You can even create
your *own* playlist to highlight decisions that you feel you haven't mastered yet.

If you use the High/Low Card Counting system, I've even created a playlist for the [Illustrious 18 and Fab 4 Surrender
Deviations](https://soundcloud.com/jackacestudios/sets/blackjack-high-low-count).

This method of learning works best as a complement to the [Blackjack Basic Strategy Charts]({{site.baseurl}}/gambling/blackjack/systems/basic-strategy/).
Once you learn the basics, you can help quiz yourself in the car, on a plane, or even subliminally in your sleep! Once you believe you've mastered Basic Strategy,
you'll be able to play blackjack with almost no house advantage!
